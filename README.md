# Luxaforus

Minimalist [Luxafor](https://luxafor.com/) client application for macOS.

## How it works

There are no explicit controls for the light, instead the light turns red when the 'Do Not Disturb' mode is enabled in the macOS Notification Center and green when it's disabled. When your computer goes to sleep mode or the application is quitting, the light will be turned off.

To speed up the 'Do Not Disturb' switching, you can set a keyboard shortcut by pressing 'Set Do Not Disturb shortcut' in the menu, selecting 'Mission Control' and setting the keys for 'Turn Do Not Disturb On/Off'.
